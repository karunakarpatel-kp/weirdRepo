          <Paragraph>
            To <B>install Next.js</B>, you need to have Node.js installed on your local machine. Make sure that you have
            the <B>latest LTS version of node.js</B>. To check the version of node.js just type <C>node -v</C> in your
            terminal and compare the version with the LTS version listed on the Node.js official website.

            After installing node.js, you will have the npm command available in the command line, where we use{" "}

            Before getting, there are two ways in which we can install Next.js, one is the
            <B>automatic Installation </B>and the other is <B>manual Installation</B>. Both work in the same way. The
            automatic installation will complete all the setup by one single command whereas less manual installation
            will complete by two to three commands. It's up to you which installation method you choose, either way in

            improving performance and <B>SEO</B>. Developers appreciate its intuitive file-based routing, automatic code
            splitting, built-in API route creation, simplifying project structure, built-in Styling, etc... This
            framework is recognized for its developer friendliness and capability to build high-performing web
            experiences.

          <HeadingFour title="What is eslint in Next.js?" />
          <Paragraph>
            <B>ESLint</B> can help Next.js developers maintain consistent code formatting, attach to coding standards,
            and catch common programming mistakes. It can be configured with specific rules and configurations, which
            can be tailored to meet the coding standards and best practices of a particular project or organization. By
            integrating <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint">ESLint</a>
            into a Next.js project, developers can ensure that their codebase remains clean, readable, and free from
            common coding errors. This can enhance code quality, collaboration among team members, and overall project
            maintainability.
          </Paragraph>

          <HeadingFour title="Why use Next.js?" />
          <Paragraph>
            <B>Next.js</B> is a popular choice for web development for several reasons which include improved
            performance, developer productivity, SEO-friendly, Automatic code splitting, Rich Ecosystem, CSS Handling,
            API Routes, and Security.
          </Paragraph>

          <HeadingFour title="Is Next.js frontend or backend?" />

          <Paragraph>
            <B>Next.js</B> is primarily a frontend framework, but it has features that blur the lines between frontend
            and backend development. It's often used to build the front end of web applications.
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            However, Next.js also supports{" "}

            />{" "}
            and serverless functions through its API routes, which can be used for backend-related tasks. These features
            allow developers to build parts of the backend logic within the Next.js application. It's especially useful
            for handling server-side rendering, routing, and APIs, effectively making <B>Next.js</B> a full-stack
            solution for many web applications.
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            In summary, <B>Next.js</B> is a frontend framework, but it has the flexibility to handle certain backend
            tasks, making it a popular choice for building full-stack web applications.
          </Paragraph>

          <HeadingFour title="Why Next.js app is good for SEO?" />

          <Paragraph>
            <B>Next.js</B> is well regarded for its SEO capabilities due to several features that improve a website's
            search engine visibility which include, Server-side rendering, Fast initial page load, Dynamic meta tags,
            structured data support, Mobile Optimization, etc... Next.js simplifies the process of creating SEO friendly
            web application.
          </Paragraph>

          <HeadingFour title="Why use Next.js over React js?" />

          <Paragraph>
            <B>Next.js</B> and React are not direct competitors but rather complementary technologies. React is a
            JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Next.js is a framework built on top of React. Your
            choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and goals of your web application.
